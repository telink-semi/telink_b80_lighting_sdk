 * @brief		This function serves to modify zb flash reset voltage(cam[6]).cam[6] default value is 0x10,when flash voltage is less than 0.5V,
 * 				the flash will reset.but in some application solution,the voltage is not decrease less than 0.5 and increase soon,in this case the
 * 				flash will power on fail,need to change the reset voltage to 1.0V(change the cam[6] to 0x00),but the flash standby current will increase
 * 				about 0.5uA.
 * @param[in]	cam_6  - the cam[6] value which you want to modify.
 * @return		0 - it is zb flash and modify success;
 * 				1 - it is zb flash and modify fail;
 * 				2 - it is not zb flash or it is zb flash but can not use this api to modify cam value;
 * 				0xff - flash is error, the cam value is change to 0x00.
 * @note		The irq will disable to avoid interrupt in the process of this api.
 * 				This process need keep the chip power on, if power down in this process will cause flash error
 * 				and can not use it in low voltage status.
 * 				The best usage is:call this api to change cam value after power on and system init,if change success,write
 * 				a flag to flash to ensure the api only call once.
 *@attention	The return value equal 0 just represent that this configuration is modify success,you need to power down the flash power and power on again
 *				to make it take effect.
