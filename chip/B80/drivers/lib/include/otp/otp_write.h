/**
 * @brief      This function serves to write data to OTP memory.
 *             the minimum unit of otp read-write operation is 4 bytes, that is a word. meanwhile, the otp cannot be burned repeatedly,
 *             this function is limited to writing only once,this function will determine if the otp is 0xffffffff, and if it is 0xffffffff,
 *             it will write the otp.
 * @param[in]  addr - the address of the data,it has to be a multiple of 4,the OTP memory that can access is from 0x0000-0x3ffc,can't access other address.
 * @param[in]  word_len  - the length of the data,the unit is word(4 bytes).
 * @param[in]  buff - data buff.
 * @return     0 :it means that the otp operation area is 0xffffffff or the write data,
 *                return 0 not mean that the burning was successful,need to use three kinds of read mode to check whether the writing was successful.
 *             1 :it means that there is an operation value in the operation area,it is not 0xffffffff or the write data,no burning action is performed.
 *
 * Attention: When the vbat voltage is greater than 3.3V, otp supply is 3.3V, if the vabt voltage is lower than 3.3V,
 * then the otp supply voltage will follow the vbat voltage value, write to otp, according to the datasheet,
 * the voltage value is at least 2.25V, if below the voltage value, you can not operate,and prompt adc sampling voltage has certain error,add by shuaixing.zhai, confirmed by baoyi 20211015.
