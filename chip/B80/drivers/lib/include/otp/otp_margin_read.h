 * @param[in]  len  - the length of the data,the unit is word(4 bytes).
 * @param[in]  buff - data buff.

 *
 * Attention: When the vbat voltage is greater than 3.3V, otp supply is 3.3V, if the vabt voltage is lower than 3.3V,
 * then the otp supply voltage will follow the vbat voltage value, write to otp, according to the datasheet,
